# User-Plane One-way Latency

The definition of *user-plane one-way latency* is the target time specified by the LTE (Long-Term Evolution) standard for one-way transit between a packet being available in the wireless device, and that same packet being available at the radio tower (today it is usually less than 10 ms). It is the one-way latency of the first wireless hop when the device is in a high-power continuous reception state, and **every** application packet must incur this cost.
